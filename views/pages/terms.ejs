<h2>Welcome To Shutr</h2>
<p>
We hope you find it useful. By accessing our servers, websites, or content therefrom (together, "Shutr"), you agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms of Use"), last updated September 15, 2015.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to access Shutr in compliance with the Terms of Use; unlicensed access is unauthorized. ALL IMAGES REMAIN PROPERTY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND CANNOT BE REUSED OR RESOLD WITHOUT THE CONSENT FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHER. You agree not to license, distribute, make derivative works, display, sell, or "frame" content from Shutr, excluding content you create and sharing with friends/family. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid or sublicensable license to use, copy, perform, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.
USE. You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed by us) or services that interact or interoperate with Shutr, e.g. for downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, and/or spam postings/email. You agree not to collect users' personal and/or contact information (â€œPI").
</p>

<h3>Moderation</h3>
<p>
You agree we may moderate Shutr access and use in our sole discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion, delay, omission, verification, and/or access/account/license termination. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. All site rules are incorporated herein.
</p>

<h3>Claims</h3>
<p>
You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim") arising out of or related to the Terms of Use or your Shutr use is governed by California ("CA") law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in San Francisco, CA (except we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year after it arose or be forever barred; (5) not to bring or take part in a class action against Shutr Entities; (6) (except government agencies) to indemnify Shutr Entities for any damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims related to your Shutr use; (7) you are liable for Terms of Use breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (8) to pay us for breaching or inducing others to breach the "use" section, not as a penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post, email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected.
</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
Users complying with prior written licenses may access Shutr thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a Terms of Use term is unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If Terms of Use translations conflict with the English version, English controls. See Privacy Policy for how we collect, use and share data. If you feel content infringes your rights contact us at legal@shutr.co.
